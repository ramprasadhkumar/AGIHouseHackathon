Alright, I need to figure out whether my boyfriend should buy the items in the incoming order based on the previous spending data. First, I'll look at the context provided. The previous spending data shows he's spent a lot on non-essential items like Electronics and Clothing. He bought things like a laptop, headphones, and a T-shirt, which add up.

Next, I'll check the monthly spend limit, which is $5,000. I'll calculate his total spending on non-essential items from the previous data. The laptop was $999.99, headphones $120, T-shirt $19.99, and the wired mouse and keyboard in the incoming order are $25.99 and $79.5, respectively. Adding these together, that's over $1,200 just on non-essentials, which is way over the $5,000 limit.

Wait, no, I think I miscalculated. The previous spending includes more items. Let me add all the non-essential items:

- Headphones: $120
- T-shirt: $19.99
- Laptop: $999.99
- Wired Headphone (incoming): $19.99
- Wired Keyboard: $79.5
- Wired Mouse: $25.99

Adding these together: 120 + 19.99 + 999.99 + 19.99 + 79.5 + 25.99. Let me add step by step.

120 + 19.99 is 139.99. Plus 999.99 is 1139.98. Adding another 19.99 makes 1159.97. Then plus 79.5 is 1239.47, and adding 25.99 gives 1265.46. That's way over the $5,000 limit. So adding the incoming order would definitely exceed the budget. Therefore, he should skip buying these items to stay within the limit.
